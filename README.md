# CarsOfThe50s
by Jaime Fins
@2004


This is a simple Java project created to generate a 1950s-style car based on configurable parameters. It allows you to define various car characteristics such as the model, color, height, wheel type, and more, with the goal of creating a visual representation of a vintage car inspired by the 1950s.

Features
Car Models: The project allows the selection of different car models, including normal cars, convertibles, and station wagons.

Customization: You can customize the colors of various parts of the car, such as the chassis, roof, windows, and even add decorative flames.

Adjustable Features: The user can adjust the number of doors, car lowering, front width, wheel type, and more.

Visualization: The code uses Java's graphical libraries (java.awt) to draw the car on the screen using a set of colors and geometric shapes to represent the vehicle.


Note: The code was originally developed as a Java Applet, but you may need to use an environment that supports applets (although Java Applets are deprecated in modern browsers, you can run them locally in a development environment).

Feel free to used it as an inspiration or for further development.
